121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

```python
import pytest

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: list[int]) -> int:
        ...

@pytest.mark.parametrize('source_list,expected', [
    ([7,1,5,3,6,4], 5),
    ([7,6,4,3,1], 0),
])
def test(source_list, expected):
    assert Solution().maxProfit(source_list) == expected
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: list[int]) -> int:
        max_profit = 0
        current_min = prices[0]
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            price = prices[i]
            max_profit = max(price - current_min, max_profit)
            current_min = min(price, current_min)
        return max_profit
