100. Same Tree

Companies
Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
from queue import deque
import pytest

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

    @classmethod
    def from_list(cls, arr: list[int | None]):
        nodes = [TreeNode(val) if val else None for val in arr]
        kids = nodes[::-1]
        root = kids.pop()
        for node in nodes:
            if node:
                if kids:
                    node.left = kids.pop()
                if kids:
                    node.right = kids.pop()
        return root

    def isSameTree(self, p: TreeNode | None, q: TreeNode | None) -> bool:
        ...
