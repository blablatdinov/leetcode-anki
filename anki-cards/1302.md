1302. Deepest Leaves Sum

Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of values of its deepest leaves.
 
Example 1:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

    @classmethod
    def from_list(cls, arr: list[int | None]):
        nodes = [TreeNode(val) if val else None for val in arr]
        kids = nodes[::-1]
        root = kids.pop()
        for node in nodes:
            if node:
                if kids:
                    node.left = kids.pop()
                if kids:
                    node.right = kids.pop()
        return root

class Solution:
    def deepestLeavesSum(self, root: TreeNode | None) -> int:
        ...


import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize('tree,expected', [
    (TreeNode.from_list([1,2,3,4,5,None,6,7,None,None,None,None,8]), 15),
    (TreeNode.from_list([6,7,8,2,7,1,3,9,None,1,4,None,None,None,5]), 19),
])
def test(tree, expected):
    assert Solution().deepestLeavesSum(tree) == expected
```

%

```python
class Solution:
    def deepestLeavesSum(self, root: TreeNode | None) -> int:
        next_lvl = [root]
        prev_lvl = []
        while next_lvl:
            prev_lvl = next_lvl
            next_lvl = []
            for node in prev_lvl:
                if node.left: next_lvl.append(node.left)
                if node.right: next_lvl.append(node.right)
        return sum([node.val for node in prev_lvl])
```
