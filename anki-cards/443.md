448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array

Companies
Given an array nums of n integers where nums[i] is in the range [1, n], return an array of all the integers in the range [1, n] that do not appear in nums.

```python
import pytest

class Solution:
    def findDisappearedNumbers(self, nums: list[int]) -> list[int]:
        ...

@pytest.mark.parametrize('source_list,expected', [
    ([4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1], [5,6]),
    ([1,1], [2]),
])
def test(source_list, expected):
    assert Solution().findDisappearedNumbers(source_list) == expected
```

%

```python
class Solution:
    def findDisappearedNumbers(self, nums: list[int]) -> list[int]:
        # Cyclic sort
        # [4, 3, 2, 7, 8, 2, 3, 1] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 7, 8]
        i = 0
        while i < len(nums):
            pos = nums[i] - 1
            if nums[i] != nums[pos]:
                nums[i], nums[pos] = nums[pos], nums[i]
            else:
                i += 1
        # Search missing number
        miss = []
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != i + 1:
                miss.append(i + 1)
        return miss
