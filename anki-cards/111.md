111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.
The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.
Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
 
Example 1:

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 2

```python
from queue import deque
import pytest

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

    @classmethod
    def from_list(cls, arr: list[int | None]):
        nodes = [TreeNode(val) if val else None for val in arr]
        kids = nodes[::-1]
        root = kids.pop()
        for node in nodes:
            if node:
                if kids:
                    node.left = kids.pop()
                if kids:
                    node.right = kids.pop()
        return root

class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root: TreeNode | None) -> int:
        ...

@pytest.mark.parametrize('tree_node,expected', [
    (TreeNode.from_list([3,9,20,None,None,15,7]), 2),
    (None, 0),
    (TreeNode.from_list([1,2,3,4,5]), 2),
])
def test(tree_node, expected):
    assert Solution().minDepth(tree_node) == expected
```

%

```python
class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root: TreeNode | None) -> list[float]:
        if not root:
            return 0
        q = deque([root])
        depth = 1
        while q:
            for _ in range(len(q)):
                node = q.popleft()
                if not node.left and not node.right:
                    return depth
                if node.left: q.append(node.left)
                if node.right: q.append(node.right)
            depth += 1
        return depth
```
