217. Contains Duplicate

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

```python
import pytest

class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: list[int]) -> bool:
        ...

@pytest.mark.parametrize('source_list,expected', [
    ([1,2,3,1], True),
    ([1,2,3,4], False),
    ([1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2], True),
])
def test(source_list, expected):
    assert Solution().containsDuplicate(source_list) is expected
```

%

```python
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: list[int]) -> list[float]:
        # alternative solution, not efficient by space:
        # return len(set(nums)) != len(nums)
        # ----------
        seen = set()
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] in seen:
                return True
            else:
                seen.add(nums[i])
        return False
```
