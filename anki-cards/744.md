744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target

You are given an array of characters letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character target. There are at least two different characters in letters.
Return the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.

```python
import pytest

class Solution:
    def nextGreatestLetter(self, letters: list[str], target: str) -> int:
        ...

@pytest.mark.parametrize('source,target,expected', [
    (['c', 'f', 'g'], 'a', 'c'),
    (['c', 'f', 'g'], 'c', 'f'),
    (['c', 'f', 'g'], 'd', 'f'),
    (['c', 'f', 'j'], 'g', 'j'),
    (['c', 'f', 'g'], 'j', 'c'),
    (['x','x','y','y'], 'z', 'x'),
])
def test(source, target, expected):
    assert Solution().nextGreatestLetter(source, target) == expected
```

```python
class Solution:
    def nextGreatestLetter(self, letters: list[str], target: str) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(letters) - 1
        while left <= right:
            middle = (left + right) // 2
            if letters[middle] > target:
                right = middle - 1
            else:
                left = middle + 1
        return letters[left % len(letters)]
```
