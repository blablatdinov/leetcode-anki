169. Majority Element

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3

```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        ...

import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize('source,expected', [
    ([3,2,3], 3),
])
def test(source,expected):
    got = Solution().majorityElement(source)

    assert got == expected
```

%

```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        result = None
        vote = 0
        for num in nums:
            if vote == 0:
                result = num
            if num == result:
                vote += 1
            else:
                vote -= 1
        return result
```
