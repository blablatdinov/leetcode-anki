112. Path Sum

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.
A leaf is a node with no children.
 
Example 1:

Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
Output: true
Explanation: The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

    @classmethod
    def from_list(cls, arr: list[int | None]):
        nodes = [TreeNode(val) if val else None for val in arr]
        kids = nodes[::-1]
        root = kids.pop()
        for node in nodes:
            if node:
                if kids:
                    node.left = kids.pop()
                if kids:
                    node.right = kids.pop()
        return root

class Solution:
    def hasPathSum(self, node: TreeNode | None, target: int) -> bool:
        ...

import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize('tree,target,expected', [
    (
        TreeNode.from_list([5,4,8,11,None,13,4,7,2,None,None,None,1]),
        22,
        True,
    ),
    (
        TreeNode.from_list([1,2,3]),
        5,
        False,
    ),
])
def test(tree, target, expected):
    assert Solution().hasPathSum(tree, target) == expected
```

```python
class Solution:
    def hasPathSum(self, node: TreeNode | None, target: int) -> bool:
        if not node: return False
        target -= node.val
        if not node.left and not node.right:
            return target == 0
        return self.hasPathSum(node.left, target) or self.hasPathSum(node.right, target)
