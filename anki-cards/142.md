142. Linked List Cycle II

Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.
There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
Do not modify the linked list.
 
Example 1:

Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, x=0):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None

    @classmethod
    def from_list(cls, arr: list[int], pos: int):
        node = cls()
        res = node
        cycle_node = None
        for idx, elem in enumerate(arr):
            node.next = ListNode(elem)
            if idx == pos:
                cycle_node = node.next
            node = node.next
        node.next = cycle_node
        return res.next

class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: ListNode | None) -> ListNode | None:
        ...

import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize('source_list,pos', [
    (ListNode.from_list([3,2,0,-4], 1), 2),
    (ListNode.from_list([1,2], 0), 1),
])
def test(source_list, pos):
    got = Solution().detectCycle(source_list)

    assert got.val == pos
```
