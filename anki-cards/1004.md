1004. Max Consecutive Ones III

Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

```python
class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
        ...

import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize('source,k,expected', [
    ([1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], 2, 6),
])
def test(source,k,expected):
    got = Solution().longestOnes(source,k)

    assert got == expected
```

```python
class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
        zeros, res, left = 0, 0, 0
        for right in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[right] == 0:
                while zeros >= k:
                    if nums[left] == 0:
                        zeros -= 1
                    left += 1
                zeros += 1
            res = max(res, right - left + 1)
        return res
```
