206. Reverse Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.
 
Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
Example 3:
Input: head = []
Output: []

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, x=0):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None

    @classmethod
    def from_list(cls, arr: list[int]):
        node = cls()
        res = node
        for elem in arr:
            node.next = ListNode(elem)
            node = node.next
        return res.next

    def to_list(self) -> list[int]:
        node = self
        res = []
        while node:
            res.append(node.val)
            node = node.next
        return res

class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode | None) -> ListNode | None:
        ...

import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize('source_list,expected', [
    (ListNode.from_list([1,2,3,4,5]), [5,4,3,2,1]),
    (ListNode.from_list([1,2]), [2,1]),
])
def test(source_list, expected):
    got = Solution().reverseList(source_list)

    assert got.to_list() == expected
```

        prev = None
        current = head
        while current:
            nxt = current.next
            current.next = prev
            prev = current
            current = nxt
