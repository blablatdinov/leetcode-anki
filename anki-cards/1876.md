1876. Substrings of Size Three with Distinct Characters

A string is good if there are no repeated characters.
Given a string s​​​​​, return the number of good substrings of length three in s​​​​​​.
Note that if there are multiple occurrences of the same substring, every occurrence should be counted.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "xyzzaz"
Output: 1
Explanation: There are 4 substrings of size 3: "xyz", "yzz", "zza", and "zaz". 
The only good substring of length 3 is "xyz".
import collections

```python
class Solution:
    def countGoodSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        ...

import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize('s,expected', [
    ('xyzzaz', 1),
    ('aababcabc', 4),
])
def test(s,expected):
    got = Solution().countGoodSubstrings(s)

    assert got == expected
```

%

```python
class Solution:
    def countGoodSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        memory, left, res = collections.defaultdict(int), 0, 0
        for right, cur_char in enumerate(s):
            memory[cur_char] += 1
            if right - left == 3:
                left_char = s[left]
                memory[left_char] -= 1
                if memory[left_char] == 0: del memory[left_char]
                left += 1
            if len(memory) == 3:
                res += 1
        return res
```
