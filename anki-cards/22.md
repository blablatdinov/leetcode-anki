22. Generate Parentheses

Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 3
Output: ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]

```python
class Solution:
    def generateParenthesis(self, n: int) -> list[str]:
        ...
    
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize('num,expected', [
    (3, ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]),
])
def test(num,expected):
    got = Solution().generateParenthesis(num)

    assert got == expected
```

%

```python
class Solution:
    def generateParenthesis(self, n: int) -> list[str]:
        result = []
        def generate(open_, close, current):
            if open_ + close == 2 * n:
                result.append(current)
                return
            if open_ < n:
                generate(open_ + 1, close, current + '(')
            if close < open_:
                generate(open_, close + 1, current + ')')
        generate(0, 0, '')
        return result
```
